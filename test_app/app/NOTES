Intent

    An Intent is an object that provides runtime binding between separate components, such as two activities.
    The Intent represents an appâ€™s "intent to do something."
    You can use intents for a wide variety of tasks, but in this lesson, your intent starts another activity.

sendMessage()

    The Intent constructor takes two parameters:
        -- A Context as its first parameter (this is used because the Activity class is a subclass of Context)
        -- The Class of the app component to which the system should deliver the Intent (in this case, the activity that should be started).

    The putExtra() method adds the EditText's value to the intent.
        -- An Intent can carry data types as key-value pairs called extras.
        -- Your key is a public constant EXTRA_MESSAGE because the next activity uses the key to retrieve the text value.
        -- It's a good practice to define keys for intent extras using your app's package name as a prefix.
        -- This ensures the keys are unique, in case your app interacts with other apps.

The startActivity() method starts an instance of the DisplayMessageActivity specified by the Intent.

Each screen in your app that is not the main entry point (all screens that are not the "home" screen) should provide
navigation so the user can return to the logical parent screen in the app hierarchy by tapping the Up button in the app bar.
